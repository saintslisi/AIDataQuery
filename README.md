# AI DB Query

**AI DB Query** is an innovative program powered by GPT-4, designed to streamline interaction with MySQL databases. With a simple user input, the program generates and executes MySQL queries on a generic database and returns the query results in a refined and user-friendly format.

## How It Works
1. The user provides an input describing the desired database query in natural language.
2. The program leverages GPT-4 to interpret the input and generate an accurate MySQL query.
3. The query is executed on the connected database.
4. Results are retrieved, reformulated, and displayed in a polished, easy-to-read format.

## Tasks

1. **Generalize Database Operations**  
   Implement core MySQL operations (search, insert, update, and delete) based on dynamic user input, ensuring flexibility and adaptability.

2. **Support for Multiple Tables with Relationships**  
   Extend functionality to handle databases with multiple tables, including the ability to manage and respect relationships between them (e.g., foreign keys).

3. **Add Memory Functionality**  
   Integrate memory capabilities to retain context and improve interaction consistency over multiple queries or sessions.

## Results Obtained

Several types of tests were conducted, and from the results, it is clear that the project works, but it must be supported by a well-designed database where tables and fields are described in detail (with examples, if necessary) and contain a sufficient amount of data. This is because some queries that users may ask, despite being correctly generated by the model, may not return any results.

During the tests, the model generated between 90% and 95% of correct queries. Based on the user's inputs, it was able to perform multiple queries across different tables and return the expected results several times. It was also capable of generating more complex queries that required information from multiple tables or applying various filters, successfully extracting the correct parameters and relating them to the appropriate attributes.

### Examples of Tested Inputs (I), Generated Queries (Q), and Obtained Outputs (O):

<details><summary>1. Query to find one-way flights in December</summary>

   - **I** - "Tell me how many flights are departing from Catania this month and find the cheapest and fastest one."
   - **Q** - 
     ```sql
     SELECT COUNT(*)
     FROM voli
     WHERE partenza = 'CTA' AND MONTH(data) = 12 AND YEAR(data) = 2024;

     SELECT *
     FROM voli
     WHERE partenza = 'CTA' AND MONTH(data) = 12 AND YEAR(data) = 2024
     ORDER BY prezzo_biglietto ASC, durata ASC
     LIMIT 1;
     ```
   - **O** - 
     ```
     This month, there are 191 flights departing from Catania. The cheapest and fastest flight departs from Catania (CTA) at 01:10 on December 19, 2024, with destination Warsaw (WAW). The flight code is AZ103, and its duration is 20 minutes. However, the flight has been cancelled. The final ticket price would have been 21.51 euros.

     AND DATE(data) BETWEEN '2024-12-22' AND '2024-12-26'
     ORDER BY prezzo_biglietto ASC, durata ASC;
     ```
   - **O** - 
     ```
     I found two return flight options from Warsaw (WAW) to Catania (CTA) in the requested period:

     1. The first flight departs on December 23, 2024, at 02:10. The flight duration is 240 minutes, and the flight code is RY107. The final ticket price is 509.17 euros.

## Test Tables of the Database

The Test Database simulates a travel platform database.  
It includes several tables with realistic fields.  
Currently, approximately 25,000 test data entries have been inserted into the DB using a data generation program.  
The data is realistic, although some entries may have inconsistencies.  

The following **test tables** have been used in the database:

1. **Planes:**  
   Used to store information about specific planes and their associated airlines.

2. **Flights** *(Relation to Planes):*  
   Contains flight-related data such as:  
   - Departure  
   - Destination  
   - Duration  
   - Price  
   - Flight Code  
   - Departure Date  

3. **Airports** *(Relation to Flights):*  
   Includes data such as:  
   - Airport IATA Code  
   - City  
   - Country  
   - Continent  

4. **Hotels:**  
   Stores hotel information, including:  
   - Name  
   - Location  
   - Number of Stars  
   - Phone Number  
   - Price Range  
   - Amenities  

5. **Rooms** *(Relation to Hotels):*  
   This table contains information about the rooms available in the hotels listed in the previous table, including:  
   - Hotel ID  
   - Room Number  
   - Type (e.g., single, double, etc.)  
   - Price  
   - Status  

6. **Rental Vehicles:**  
   Stores details about vehicles available for rent, such as:  
   - Model  
   - Brand  
   - License Plate  
   - Fuel Type  
   - Type (e.g., car, van, etc.)  
   - Daily Price  

7. **Restaurants:**  
   Provides information about a list of restaurants, including:  
   - Name  
   - Address  
   - Rating  
   - Operating Hours Information  
   - Price Range  

## Issues and Solutions

### Issues

1. **Multi-query SELECT**  
   When performing searches that involve multiple tables, the system generates multiple queries.  

2. **Insertion with Records Containing Foreign Keys**  
   During data insertion, the process must handle records with foreign keys and verify relationships between tables.  

3. **Memory Management**  
   Initial memory handling caused performance issues due to the storage of static messages and excessive data.  

4. **Table and Field Descriptions**  
   For optimal functionality, the database requires detailed descriptions of tables and fields.  

---

### Solutions

1. **Multi-query SELECT**  
   - The issue was resolved by modifying the function to manage multi-queries efficiently.  
   - The generated queries are executed by the database, and their results are stored in a list.  
   - This list is then passed to the model for processing.  

2. **Insertion with Foreign Key Records**  
   - Unlike other operations, insertion requires verifying that all non-NULL data is present and that foreign key relationships are valid.  
   - This was resolved by:  
     - Extracting all related tables.  
     - Generating auxiliary SELECT queries using the LLM to find the correct foreign keys.  
     - Passing these results to the LLM to generate and execute the final INSERT query.  

3. **Improved Memory Management**  
   - Initially, memory was overloaded with static messages embedded in the code.  
   - The solution involved:  
     - Storing only the user's initial input and the LLM's final output in memory.  
     - Implementing a fixed sliding window with a LIFO structure for managing requests.  

4. **Detailed Table and Field Descriptions**  
   - The program now requires a well-designed MySQL database where every table and field is thoroughly commented.  
   - Adding detailed descriptions ensures that every element is well-documented, improving both functionality and usability.
